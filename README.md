# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this week's project, we build our first mobile application with React Native! It was a free project, we could do any app we wanted and our only restrictions was that it should be a mobile app created with React Native and using styled components.

I created a app with beautiful and trending images from pexels, so I fetched the images with an api and used the share method with a button. I also linked the image to the image url and linked the photograhers name to the photographers url.

I felt confident with the components in this project, but it was hard in the beginning to start with almost a new language, but i learned it fast. I understood to use the share method in the beginning, but had a hard time to know how to use the id in within the share method. I reached out to stack overflow among others and finally figured it out.

If I had more time I would have created a navigation to select other types of images with other api's.
