# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this project, I build my first mobile application with beautiful and trending images from pexels! I used React Native and styled components.

To do the app I fetched the images with an api from pexels and used the share method within a button. I also linked the image to the image url and linked the photograhers name to the photographers url.

I felt confident with the components in this project, but it was hard in the beginning to start with almost a new language, but i learned it fast. I understood to use the share method in the beginning, but had a hard time to know how to use the id in within the share method. I reached out to stack overflow among others and finally figured it out.

If I had more time I would have created a navigation to select other types of images with other api's.
